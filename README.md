# WikiNode

WikiNode is a final-year project I built to transform the way we explore Wikipedia. Instead of a long list of articles, it turns Wikipedia into an interactive graph that makes discovering connections between topics fun and intuitive.

## What It Does

- **Explore & Discover:** Type in any Wikipedia article and see its related articles displayed as connected nodes.
- **Interactive Graph:** Click nodes to expand the network and uncover hidden relationships.
- **Simple & Responsive:** Enjoy a clean interface with dark/light mode support.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repo:**  
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wikinode.git`
2. **Open It:**  
   Launch `index.html` in your browser to start exploring.

I built WikiNode to spark curiosity and help people see how interconnected knowledge really is. Enjoy exploring!
